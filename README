This is the CEAN framework.

Here is minimal instructions to setup a working directory.

1) make sure you have git 1.7 and zsh 4.3 installed   (tested on osx and debian)

  osx:
      * Install homebrew: http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/
      * brew install git tig
  debian:
      * apt-get install git-core git-svn git-doc tig zsh
  archlinux:
      * pacman -S git tig zsh
  netbsd:
      * pkgin in scmgit tig zsh-4.3.10nb2

2) get the cean framework

 there are 3 profile: mini (default), base, full. when bootstraping your working
 directory, you choose which profile you want. mini only contains compiler kernel
 stdlib and few libs. base contains most usefull libs (console). full contains all
 otp libs.

cd $HOME
git clone git@github.com:cromain/cean.git .cean  ($HOME/.cean is mandatory)
export PATH=$HOME/.cean/bin:$PATH
cean create R16 R16B03-1 base
if it complains about missing dependencies you will not use, just force install
cean force create R16 R16B03-1 base
cean shell R16

 note: you can check generated archives into
 $HOME/.cache/cean/sources
 $HOME/.cache/cean/bootstraps

3) let's build yaws package and install it in workdir
R16B03-1: > package yaws
R16B03-1: > ls src/yaws
R16B03-1: > ls pub/src/yaws
R16B03-1: > ls pub/bin/linux-x86_64/R16/yaws
R16B03-1: > src/otp
R16B03-1:otp:tags/OTP_R16B03-1^0(OTP_R16B03-1): ?>
R16B03-1:otp:tags/OTP_R16B03-1^0(OTP_R16B03-1): ?> cdr
R16B03-1: >
R16B03-1: > erl
Erlang R16B03-1 (erts-5.10.4) [source] [64-bit] [smp:4:4] [async-threads:10] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false]

Eshell V5.10.4  (abort with ^G)
1> cean:is_installed(yaws).
2> q().

4) let's check what are available commands, get help for one of them and try
R16B03-1> help
R16B03-1> help package/depends
R16B03-1> package/depends yaws

4) exit the cean shell (ctrl+d)

5) create a new base working environement
cean create anotherR16 R16B03-1 full
cean shell anotherR16

6) build all Erlang OTP packages
R16B03-1> package otp

7) check packages
R16B03-1> package/list
R16B03-1> package/search web
