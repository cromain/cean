{summary, "Automatically balance mnesia tables (or general erlang processes) in response to node set changes"}.
{abstract, "Mnesia is Erlang's built-in distributed database. It provides primitives for adding nodes to the "
 "database set and to manage fragments, but does not prescribe any high-level strategies.<br>"
 "Fragmentron provides one strategy for automatically distributing data as nodes are added and removed from "
 "the system. This simplifies Mnesia administration in a dynamic environment, e.g., EC2.<br>"
 "gen_herd is a generalization of the fragmentron strategy to arbitrary Erlang processes, intended for "
 "partitioned services that need to be automatically (re)distributed across a computing cluster."}.
