{abstract, "In a few words, Tsung is a distributed load testing tool. "
 "It is protocol-independent and can currently be used to stress Jabber/XMPP server, "
 "but also HTTP, SOAP, and postgreSQL servers. Developed as an extensible framework, "
 "this tools can be used to generate very large realistic benchmarks on a limited number of servers.<br>"
 "Tsung is a tool that allow to simulate the behaviour of a large number of users "
 "of a given application. It thus allows to analyze the capability of the stressed "
 "system under an heavy load, and provide reports to improve the performance and design of the target system."}.
