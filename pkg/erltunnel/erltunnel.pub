{summary, "ErlTunnel is an HTTP tunnel client and server written in Erlang for tunneling TCP connections over HTTP"}.
{abstract, "Erltunnel is an HTTP tunnel with a small set of API functions. "
 "It is tested using the latest Erlang release on Ubuntu Linux but should run as well on other platforms. "
 "It is tested in particular to pass the Squid proxy. Remember, however, that whether the tunnel client "
 "can connect to the tunnel server may depend on the individually defined access rules. "
 "For example, the HTTP request might be refused because the user-agent header line does not mention "
 "the right client application the proxy is configured for. In such a situation you have to adjust the code "
 "that produces the header lines in order to match your specific needs. The Erltunnel code is written "
 "with focus on simplicity, thus modifying these functions should be straightforward. "
 "<br>Erltunnel currently provides the following features:"
 "<ul>"
 "<li>tunneling any TCP/IP connections over persistent or non-persistent HTTP connections"
 "<li>tunnel client accessible by SOCKS 4 proxy protocol, i.e. client application must understand SOCKS 4"
 "<li>tunneling with or without an intermediate proxy"
 "<li>optional proxy authentication (user, password)"
 "</ul>"}.
