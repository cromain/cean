{abstract, "erlrc is designed to make it easy to integrate your OS package manager with erlang's "
 "hot code loading mechanism. It consists of an extensible boot procedure controlled by a directory, "
 "and hooks for upgrading and downgrading individual applications (with shell script interface). "
 "Also includes an automatic appup file generation scheme which incorporates most of the cases "
 "from the appup cookbook."}.
