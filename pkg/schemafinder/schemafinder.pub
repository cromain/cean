{summary, "automatically maintain a distributed mnesia configuration"}.
{abstract, "Schemafinder starts up the local Mnesia and joins a schema defined at other nodes as discovered "
 "by the indicated nodefinder strategy and the indicated schemafinder group. It also provides a mechanism for "
 "identifying and pruning mnesia nodes that are permanantly out of service. Finally it allows optional "
 "reuse of the Mnesia directory during shutdown and guards against joining with a stale schema after having "
 "been removed (which, if not guarded against, leads to undefined behavior).<br>"
 "Combined these capabilities greatly ease administration and maintenance of Mnesia in a dynamic environment such as EC2."
 "Unfortunately, schemafinder currently does not assist in recovering from networking partitioning."}.
