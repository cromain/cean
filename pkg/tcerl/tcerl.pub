{abstract, "tokyocabinet is a DBM style library which boasts excellent space and time efficiency. "
 "This project provides a low-level port of tokyocabinet to Erlang via a linked-in driver, "
 "which supports storage of binaries. It also provides a high level erlang term store interface which "
 "mimics dets very closely. The erlang term store can serve as an mnesia table via mnesiaex."}.
