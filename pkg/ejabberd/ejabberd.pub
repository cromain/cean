{abstract, "ejabberd is a high-performance instant messaging server. "
 "An instant messaging server allows to transfer presence and status information "
 "between users connected to serverse and support real-time communications between them.<br>"
 "ejabberd relies on XMPP (eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) a largely-accepted XML "
 "protocol standardized by the IETF (The Internet Engineering Task Force). "
 "The protocol evolution is handled by the XMPP Standards Foundation (XSF), "
 "whose mission is to create the world's best protocols for instant messaging, presence, "
 "and other forms of near-real-time communication based on XML."}.
