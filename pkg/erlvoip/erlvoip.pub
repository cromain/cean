{abstract, "ErlVoIP is a collection of Voice Over IP modules that are going to be tired together "
 "to create a VoIP server written in Erlang. "
 "The current design for ErlVoIP will include connecting to a SIP provider and using RTP. "
 "A voicemail system and a way for SIP clients to connect to the VoIP server are also on the design goals. "
 "In the long run, this project is meant to create a fully functional PBX style telephone switch that "
 "will be fully distributed and easily expanded without needing to recompile or restart ErlVoIP. "
 "ErlVoIP is part of the Erlang Internet Framework."}.
