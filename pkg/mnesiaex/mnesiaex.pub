{summary, "Storage API extensions for Mnesia"}.
{abstract, "Mnesia is the Erlang built-in multi-master distributed database. Unfortunately, Mnesia only "
 "ships with support for two types of data storage (ets and dets) both of which have limitations.<br>"
 "This project defines a new behaviour mnesia_ext, and patches mnesia to support using modules which "
 "conform to the behaviour for storage. This allows for arbitrary storage strategies to be incorporated.<br>"
 "As a (useful!) example tcerl contains an implementation of an ordered_set disk-based mnesia table."}.
