 "extension over gen_server, but it was a common pattern in our code worth abstracting "
 "(non-overlapping periodic execution with a force-now feature); perhaps you will find the same.<br>"
 "Note this is a library for Erlang development, not a replacement of the OS utility cron.<br>"
 "genexpire is an example using gencron. It periodically enforces a (per-node) size limit on Mnesia databases."}.
